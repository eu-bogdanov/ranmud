  description: "A row of ranges takes up most of the space in this kitchen. Much of the steel is corroded and everything appears disused. This is a rat's haven. There is a door leading to the taproom, and another to a dry storage room."
  short_desc: "This room is filled with old and rusty culinary equipment. Two sets of swinging doors lead to the taproom and a storage room."
  dark_desc: "The dim glow from the taproom spills in and reflects off the crooked angles of the stovetops. Red eyes watch you from forgotten nooks and crannies."
