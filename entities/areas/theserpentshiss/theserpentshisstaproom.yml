  en: "Bronzed metal stools line the bar of the taproom, opposite its entrance. Behind the counter loom enormous steel vats, hooked by all manner of hoses to a nest of taps in the center of the bar, taps festooned with serpent's heads representing all manner of subspecies. The walls are adorned in fading ogee wallpaper in hues of crimson and gold. Behind the bar is the kitchen area. To the northeast are the stairs leading up to the private rooms. To the south is the exit. To the southeast is a private booth shrouded by a ragged velvet portiere in royal crimson."
