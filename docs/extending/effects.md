to name a few.

However, effects in Ranvier are not simple buffs and debuffs; they receive all of the events the target receives. A few examples of how effects can be combined with other aspects of Ranvier's engine with interesting results:

* Trapped chests that causes damage over time to the player when opened
* A weapon that cause the player to be healed for a percentage of the damage they deal
* Extra experience when grouped with other players
* Boots that make a Kick skill to 20% more damage
* A silence effect preventing the player from using certain channels
* Cause the player to dream while sleeping
